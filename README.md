## What is Query Fetch?

The Fetch API often lacks necessary features, requiring direct implementation. You have to handle retries on failure, token renewal, request and response logging, request cancellation, and more on your own. Additionally, you often need to repeat the same configurations for every request.

Moreover, dealing with Promise objects can be quite challenging. Using Promises for asynchronous processing can lead to complex structures and difficult error handling. Managing multiple asynchronous requests sequentially or in parallel can reduce code readability and maintainability.

To address these issues, Query Fetch was created. It alleviates the burden of network communication, allowing you to focus on your core logic!

## Features

- **Instance Management**: Query Fetch allows you to create multiple instances, each with different settings. This makes it easy to manage integrations with various API endpoints or services.
- **Automatic Retries**: Automatically retries requests in case of network errors or server issues.
- **Request Cancellation**: Provides the ability to cancel unnecessary requests.
- **Token Management**: Automatically refreshes authentication tokens when they expire and retries the request.
- **Type Safe**: Fully supports TypeScript, ensuring accurate type inference and minimizing unnecessary types.
