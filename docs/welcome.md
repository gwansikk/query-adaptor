Welcome to the Query Adaptor documentation! The document you are currently viewing is the official documentation.

## What is Query Adaptor?

Fetch API only provides basic functionality, often requiring developers to implement additional features themselves. For example, automatic retries on request failure, renewing authentication tokens, logging requests and responses, and canceling requests are not supported by the Fetch API and need to be manually added. Additionally, there's the hassle of repeatedly writing the same configurations.

To overcome these limitations, Query Adaptor was developed. As the name suggests, it allows for simple, query-like usage that reduces the complexity of network communication logic. Use it declaratively, like making a simple query, to lessen the burden of handling network communication and focus on your core logic!
